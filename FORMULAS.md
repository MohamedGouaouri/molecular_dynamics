## Lennar jones potential
The Lennard-Jones potential describes the potential energy of interaction between two non-bonding atoms or molecules based on their distance of separation  
The commonly used formula to comute it is:  
$ V_{LJ}(r) =  4\epsilon [ (\frac{\sigma}{r})^{12} - (\frac{\sigma}{r})^{6} ]$  
where $r$ is the distance between the two interacting particles, $\epsilon$ is the dispersion energy, and $\sigma$ is the distance at which the particle-particle potential energy $V_{LJ}$ is zero.

## Acceleration computation
We use $Newton's$ formula $F = m.a \implies a = \frac{F}{m}$  
In order to calculate forces on  each particle we use the derivative of the Lennard-Jones potential.

## kinetic energy formula
The kinetic energy formula is stated as follows:  
$K = \frac{1}{2} m.v^{2}$
